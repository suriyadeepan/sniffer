1. WTH is payload?

        When data is sent over the Internet, each unit transmitted includes both
        header information and the actual data being sent. The header identifies the
        source and destination of the packet, while the actual data is referred to as
        the payload. Because header information, or overhead data, is only used in
        the transmission process, it is stripped from the packet when it reaches its
        destination. Therefore, the payload is the only data received by the
        destination system.
